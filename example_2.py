'''
Python-based gift exchange randomizer. 
Step through a list of people and, for each member of that list, 
select someone else to be a recipient of their gift. That recipient:
    
    A) Must not be themselves (no self-gifting)
    B) Must not already have been assigned as a recipient

# For each person, assemble a list of possible recipients.

    # Init a list to store potential recipients in
